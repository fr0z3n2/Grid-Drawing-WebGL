What is it? <a name="whatisit"></a>
===========
The goal is to simulate computational graphics concepts that occur when drawing
pixels on a raster display. First, the geometry is calculated to know where to
draw the pixel, circle, or line. Then, then the image is rasterized to fit the
pixel display and show the drawing. This just to give an idea how computational
graphics work.
